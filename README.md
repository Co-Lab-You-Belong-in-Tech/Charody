## Problem Background
Our problem contains two users; Disaster relief case manager (DRCM) and homeowners willing to host evacuees of CA wildfires.
 
Every year CA wildfires force thousands of individuals and families to evacuate their homes. From our research we’ve found that between 2015 and 2021, CA wildfires destroy an average of 8,444 structures every year, many of them being homes. The 2018 Northern California Campfire alone destroyed 13,900 homes and forced 52,000 citizens to evacuate their neighborhoods in Butte County. In turn, CA wildfires displace families from their homes leaving them with few options to find a place to temporarily live while they rebuild their lives.
 
Disaster relief workers have the burden of locating and providing shelter for sometimes thousands of evacuated families and individuals. In cases where families cannot immediately return to their homes after a wildfire, disaster relief caseworkers help them find temporary housing, sometimes in the form of hotels and motels. Often, the caseworkers run into expense issues as the organizations they work for cannot afford to pay for motels or hotels for extended periods of time. The families themselves cannot afford the hotels either. As a result, caseworkers run out of housing options for the families and do not have the ability to provide any temporary housing solutions. Disaster relief caseworkers need more options to safely and securely house families whose homes have been lost or threatened by CA Wildfires.
 
There are homeowners who are willing to provide temporary housing to families who have evacuated their homes due to natural disasters like floods and fires. However, the concern of many of these homeowners is their inability to validate families who are actual victims of disasters. They don’t want to host people who are taking advantage of their kindness. Additionally, they want to know that the family they are hosting truly needs help from disaster and are good actors.

## Features
By creating a way for Disaster relief workers to see homeowners who’ve expressed their willingness to temporary house evacuees due to Wildfires, more unhoused families will be placed in safe and secure temporary housing. When Disaster relief officials can connect with homeowners who want to host families in need, more evacuated families affected by wildfires will get the shelter they need.
 
* Provide more temporary housing options for CA disaster relief workers to place unhoused victims of CA wildfire
* Allow CA wildfire officials to view a list of temporary housing profiles
* Increase the number of evacuated families placed in safe and secure temporary housing
* Provide an easy way in which CA homeowners can post availability and willingness to provide temporary housing
* Increase the inventory of temporary housing for evacuees during CA Wildfires
